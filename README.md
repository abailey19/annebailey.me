# Personal Profile Website

## Note
This is an archived site that I built for my application to Dartmouth's DALI lab, in the spring of 2019. The domain has expired since.

## The Webpage
My personal profile website contains a photo of me, a brief introduction to who I am, and descriptions of some of my coding projects and other interests. I've also included ways to get in contact with me at the bottom. 

## Next Steps
I am glad to have learned HTML and CSS in order to create this project over the past few days. In the future, I hope to expand my knowledge of these languages to make the site more visually appealing, as well as perhaps add some more content.
